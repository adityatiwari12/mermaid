## Project Overview

Health Saarthi is a full-stack, production-ready TypeScript application that combines AI-powered disease detection, multilingual voice/text chatbot, wearable integration, ambulance tracking, vaccination scheduling, and administrative dashboards into one platform. It reduces late diagnoses, encourages preventive care adoption, and improves access for low-literacy or multilingual users.

Technical materials (architecture, workflows, diagrams) used to craft this README come from the project PPT and technical specification supplied with the project. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Why this project matters
- Early triage and diagnostics reduce burden on tertiary care.
- Voice and multilingual interfaces increase usability in low-literacy contexts.
- Wearable connectivity and push reminders improve preventive adherence.

---

## Objectives

- Provide a unified health companion covering triage, diagnosis, reminders, and emergency workflows.
- Maintain end-to-end type safety using TypeScript (shared contracts).
- Prioritize HTTPS for Web Bluetooth and geolocation features.
- Support both serverful (Node) and serverless (Netlify/Vercel) deployment models.
- Keep the code modular, testable, and CI-driven.

## Features

- ü©∫ ML-powered disease detection  
  Upload skin/oral/X-ray images; PyTorch models (server or ML microservice) return label, confidence, and recommended next steps.

## Architecture

The project uses a unified Vite dev server for local development, an Express backend for APIs, and PyTorch/YOLOv8 services for ML/vision tasks. Shared TypeScript contracts live in `shared/api.ts` to keep client and server synchronized.

Mermaid diagrams below describe the topology, image-diagnosis sequence, and reminder data flow.
